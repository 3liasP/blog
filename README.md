# Bytes and Beyond: A 3liasP Blog
This is a blog hosted on Github Pages and written by me, the owner of this repository, 3liasP. The blog aims to cover various aspects of information technology, including programming languages, web development, embedded systems, and more.

## About
The blog is created using Github Pages, which is a static site hosting service provided by Github. It is built using Jekyll, a static site generator that converts plain text files into HTML pages. The content of the blog is written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language that is easy to write and read.

The blog uses a Jekyll theme called [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) as it's base. However, I've done numerous modifications to the default theme, including custom CSS and HTML-files.

I've also taken advantage of Ruby and it's Gem [Bundler](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/tree/master/bundler) to install additional Gems to be able to test the site locally on my machine before deployment. One of the Gems I use is [Webbrick](https://github.com/ruby/webrick) which includes tools to create a HTTP server that can be configured further.

## Reasons for this project
- To learn CSS and HTML in practise and having a chance to build a simple website with my own preferences.
- To host a blog to write from my experiences as a learner and to potentionally add some coding tutorials in the future
- To learn the basics of Ruby and using it in practise
- To learn more about static site generation
