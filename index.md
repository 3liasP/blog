Welcome to my blog! I am a dedicated student currently studying information technology for my bachelor's degree at the University of Turku. As a student and future programmer, I think my best qualities are a strong work ethic, self-motivation, and a passion for learning.

On my GitHub profile, you will find a collection of my school-related projects, alongside a few personal ones. These projects showcase my knowledge and expertise in various programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Python and lastly, C.

Check out my first post below to learn more about me, including my skills as a programmer.
