Welcome to my blog! I am a dedicated student currently studying information technology for my bachelor's degree at the University of Turku. As a student, I my best qualities are a strong work ethic, self-motivation, and a passion for learning.

On my Github profile, you will find a collection of my school-related projects, alongside a few personal ones. These projects showcase my knowledge and expertise in various programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Pythona and lastly, C.

Java is arguably the programmin language that I'm most familiar with, although at the moment I'm heavile also into JavaScript.

Java is the chosen programming language for most of my courses. It's a great choice for learning, beacause it's one of the most polular programming languages used for developing desktop and web applications. It is widely used in the development of Android apps and provides extensive libraries for developing robust applications. JavaScript, on the other hand, is the go-to language for web development, enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

I've also done some work in Python and I'm fairly familiar with it and it's strenghts. Python is a general-purpose language, well-suited for scripting, automation, and data analysis. The last two familiar languages for me are C and SQL. I learned C while studying embedded systems at the university. I learned that it's a foundational language for systems programming, providing developers with low-level control over the hardware. That's also one of the reasons why it's one the most polular langauge when it comes to embedded systems. SQl was something I learned while studying the fundamentals of databases. It's the standard language for working with relational databases, making it a critical skill for any aspiring programmer.

As someone with aspirations of becoming a programmer, I understand the importance of keeping up with the latest developments in the field. The programming industry is rapidly growing and evolving, with new languages, frameworks, and tools being developed every day. With a solid foundation in programming languages, I am well-positioned to adapt to these changes and stay ahead of the curve.

Currently, I am focusing on web development and embedded systems. Web development involves creating websites, web applications, and other web-based software, while embedded systems are specialized computer systems designed to perform specific tasks. I am excited about the potential of these fields and look forward to exploring them further.

In this blog, you can expect to read about my experiences as a student and programmer, my thoughts on programming languages and frameworks, and my insights into the future of the field. I will also be sharing tutorials, code snippets, and other resources that I find helpful and informative. Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I hope you find my blog informative and engaging.
